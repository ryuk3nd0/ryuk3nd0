### Hi there 👋

I'm Shahariar Shovon — a dedicated engineer with a strong foundation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (BUET) and hands-on experience in wireless communication systems, Python scripting, and automation.

🛰️ I recently worked at **Huawei Technologies** as a **Wireless RAN System Engineer**, focusing on 2G–4G modernization under the Teletalk project. My role included site integration, rectification, and developing Python automation scripts that significantly improved deployment workflows.

💻 I'm proficient in **Python**, **C/C++**, **MATLAB**, and **HTML**, and experienced in tools like Git, Excel VBA, and Azure. My academic and personal projects include:
- **IoT-based patient monitoring systems**
- **Smart home automation with Raspberry Pi**
- **ML-powered anomaly detection in crowded video environments** using YOLOv8 on a custom-built dataset

🔬 I'm actively exploring the intersection of wireless systems and intelligent automation to solve real-world problems.
